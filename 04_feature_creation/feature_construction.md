# Feature Construction

Feature construction is the process of creating new features
from existing data to improve model performance.

---

## Why feature construction is important
- Captures hidden patterns
- Improves model accuracy
- Adds domain knowledge

---

## Examples
- Total_Income = Salary + Business_Income
- Age = Current_Year - Birth_Year
- Loan_to_Income_Ratio = Loan / Income

---

## Common techniques
- Mathematical combinations
- Aggregations
- Date-time extraction
- Ratios and percentages

---

## Advantages
- Increases predictive power
- Makes data more meaningful

---

## Disadvantages
- Can increase complexity
- Risk of overfitting

---

## One-liner
Feature construction creates new meaningful features from existing data.
