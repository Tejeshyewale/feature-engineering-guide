# Standardization

Standardization transforms data to have:
- Mean = 0
- Standard Deviation = 1

---

## Formula
Z = (X - μ) / σ

---

## When to use
- Data follows normal distribution
- Algorithms assume centered data

---

## Common algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- PCA

---

## Advantages
- Handles different scales
- Less affected by outliers than normalization

---

## Disadvantages
- Does not bound data to a fixed range

---

## One-liner
Standardization centers data around zero with unit variance.
